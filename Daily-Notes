September 26th, 2015

- Removed Spotify and Gnome-shell-pomodora to reduce dependency on AUR and also because they weren't used much.

September 17th, 2015
--------------------
- Installed unrar to provide multi-part rar extraction capability
- Updated packages telegram-desktop-bin (AUR) and google-chrome (AUR)
- Thinking about updating dhcpcd, network-manager and checking if eduroam still works.
- Don't remove empathy as it somehow stop polari from working
- Removed gnome-photos as it was useless and replaced it with shotwell.

September 12th, 2015
--------------------
- Removed sushi (nautilus previewer) as it is clunky and not used at all.
- Removed archey3 and arch-firefox-search as they seem redundant and useless.
- Upgrade cower (AUR) and telegram (AUR)
- Removed gnome-software and its dependencies.
- Decided to not install vocal as it pulls in several dependencies.

September 10th, 2015
--------------------
- It seems Evolution is needed to be able to view google calendars in the top panel. Do not uninstall Evolution.
- Downgraded dhcpcd to 6.2-1 to be able to connect to Eduroam.
- Consider installing Vocal Podcast Client?
- Create a document with a list of the gnome-shell add-ons installed.
