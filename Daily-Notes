September 12th, 2015
--------------------
- Upgrade cower (AUR) and telegram (AUR)
- Removed gnome-software and its dependencies.
- Decided to not install vocal as it pulls in several dependencies.

September 10th, 2015
--------------------
- It seems Evolution is needed to be able to view google calendars in the top panel. Do not uninstall Evolution.
- Downgraded dhcpcd to 6.2-1 to be able to connect to Eduroam.
- Consider installing Vocal Podcast Client?
- Create a document with a list of the gnome-shell add-ons installed.
