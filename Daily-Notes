Notes
-----

September 17th, 2015
--------------------
- Updated packages telegram-desktop-bin (AUR) and google-chrome (AUR)
- Thinking about updating dhcpcd, network-manager and checking if eduroam still works.

September 13th, 2015
--------------------
- Removed terminator as gnome-terminal meets all its needs
- Replaced epiphany with google-chrome as backup browser.
- Checked working of google-hangouts
- Removed gnome-weather and gnome-fonts

September 12th, 2015
--------------------
- Removed sushi (nautilus previewer) as it is clunky and not used at all.
- Removed archey3 and arch-firefox-search as they seem redundant and useless.
- Upgrade cower (AUR) and telegram (AUR)
- Removed gnome-software and its dependencies.
- Decided to not install vocal as it pulls in several dependencies.

September 10th, 2015
--------------------
- It seems Evolution is needed to be able to view google calendars in the top panel. Do not uninstall Evolution.
- Downgraded dhcpcd to 6.2-1 to be able to connect to Eduroam.
- Consider installing Vocal Podcast Client?
- Create a document with a list of the gnome-shell add-ons installed.

September 9th, 2015
-------------------
- Installed Gnome-Pomodoro App. Seems useful!
