Solution

Wiki Entry: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_configuration#Ubuntu
Other Resources: https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/kt3ir/my_arch_system_looks_ugly_please_help_fonts_might/

Installing the following Ubuntu Patched font-rendering packages,
- freetype2-ubuntu (conflicts with freetype2)
- fontconfig-ubuntu (conflicts with fontconfig)
- cairo-ubuntu (conflicts with cairo)

The conflicted packages were removed. So if any font issues are found, restore the unpatched packages, reinstall the original packages freetype2, cairo, and fontconfig as dependencies (use the --asdeps flag with pacman when reinstalling).They should be in the /var/cache/pacman/pkg folder.

Also installed, adobe-source-han-sans-otc-fonts, ttf-freefont, ttf-symbola
